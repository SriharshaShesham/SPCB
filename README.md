# **Welcome to SharePoint Code Blocks (SPCB)**

# What is SPCB?

### SharePoint Code Blocks(SPCB) hosts various code blocks a.k.a functions that I have been using over the years which I think can help any SharePoint developer to accomplish most of the common requirements with ease.

# Which SharePoint versions these blocks work on?

### These blocks are supported in SharePoint 2016 and above environments including SharePoint Online(Classic view only).

# What you can do with SPCB?

### I will be posting some of the beautiful UI components that you can implement for SharePoint using the SPCB and other good practices in [my blog](http://blog.sheshams.in)
